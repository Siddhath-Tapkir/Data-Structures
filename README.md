# Data Structures Journey 🧩🚀

This repository marks the beginning of my **Data Structures journey**, where I explored and implemented fundamental data structures in **C**, **C++**, and **Java**.

---

## 📍 About
- 🧠 Started learning **core data structures** from scratch.  
- 💻 Implemented each structure in **C**, **C++**, and **Java** to understand logic and syntax across languages.  
- ⚙️ Focused on **understanding internal working** and **memory management**.

---

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- 🔗 **Singly Linear Linked List**  
- 🔁 **Singly Circular Linked List**  
- 🔗 **Doubly Linear Linked List**  
- 🔁 **Doubly Circular Linked List**  
- 📦 **Stack**  
- 📥 **Queue**  
- 🌳 **Binary Search Tree (BST)**  

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- Languages: **C**, **C++**, **Java**  
- Compiler: **GCC**, **g++**, **javac**  
- OS: **Linux**

---

## 🚀 Goal
To gain a **deep understanding of data structure logic**, improve problem-solving, and prepare for **system-level and algorithmic development**.

---

**“Data structures are the foundation — logic is the key.”**
